# Predicting Bundesliga Match Results

In this project, our aim is to build a machine learning model to predict match results in Bundesliga, Germany's primary football leagues.

We first scrape data from [http://fbref.com](http://fbref.com) using Requests, BeautifulSoup and Pandas, and create a csv file containing match logs over six seasons.

After cleaning and getting our data set ready for machine learning, we build models predicting who will win a match using Scikit-Learn.

We measure the error, improve our predictions, and compare performances of different models on our data set.
